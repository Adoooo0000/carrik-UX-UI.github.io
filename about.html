  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p class="description">&ensp;&ensp;Hi there! My name is Carrik,
     and I am a UX/UI designer with a passion for innovation and learning. 
     I received my training under the Google UX Design Certificate Course, 
     which gave me a strong foundation in the design process, from research to usability testing. 
     Since then, I have worked on two projects on my own, 
     allowing me to gain hands-on experience and refine my skills. 
     In addition to my design expertise, 
     I have a basic knowledge of HTML and CSS, C++, Excel VBA, and Python. 
     I am proficient in using Figma and Adobe XD, and I am always eager to learn new tools. 
     In fact, this website was created with the help of AI code editor tools. 
     As a designer, I am constantly inspired by the work of others 
     and regularly watch other designers’ projects to stay up-to-date with the latest design trends. 
     I am excited to continue my journey as a UX/UI designer 
    and create innovative solutions that make a positive impact.</p>
